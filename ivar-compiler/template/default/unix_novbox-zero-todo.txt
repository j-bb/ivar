* reduce time, currently 15-20 minutes after the machine is ready on the cloud
* use firewall
* add more security like fail2ban and prepare some scripts in prod like checklog
* upgrade a new targapp version without setup the system
* email when system upgrade is needed. Warning, it is not allowed to send email from OVH cloud
* try postgresSQL
* backup ? Even for a test machine, what'ses happen if we cut the machine and the customer want to start again testing ?
* plug real novbox without partition cypher but not the novbox-zero
* add more "compile option" or a new concept than compile option to specify the target prod system.
Currently, the targapp is deployed locally AND the novbox-zero scripts are generated.
* Better sys param : tomcat port, database port, password, ...
* solve SSH key change warning because it is always new machines on OVH cloud
* chmod u+x *.sh automatically on novbox-zero gototocloud.sh script

It works
    - on debian 64 bits : 7 min with errors
    - on ubuntu server 10.04 : 20 min without errors
